# Adequate Sync Proposal

Thanks for reviewing the proposal! I would especially like feedback on questions like:

- Are there fundamental problems in this approach that would make it unworkable?
- Are there problems I've missed that need to be considered?
- Are there additional constraints that would be necessary for this to be a good solution?
- Is there another approach that would be equally easy to implement, but would provide better safety?
